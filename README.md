The lab has been divided into two parts. 

In the part one, using the wavefront algorithm, the
attraction function is created. Once the attraction function is created, the paths needs to find. In
the potential function, it may be get trapped into local minima which needs to avoid by finding
solutions. 

In the part two, bushfire algorithm is used to easily compute the distance to obstacles.
Potential fields motion planning algorithms utilize attraction fields to move from the origin to the
destination.
